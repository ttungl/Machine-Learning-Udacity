# Machine-Learning-Udacity

This [Machine Learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning projects. This was developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.

At first, I tended to take this course but after reviewing the syllabus, most of the concepts are covered in `Machine Learning by Stanford University, Andrew Ng`, so I decided to go only through the projects, instead. 

# Outline:

#### Exploratory Project: Titanic Survival Exploration
+ Model Evaluation and Validation.

#### Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
+ Supervised Learning.

#### Project 2: Finding donors for CharityML
+ Supervised Learning: Discuss the tradeoffs between unsupervised learning algorithms and select one that is appropriate for data analysis.

#### Project 3: Creating Customer Segments 
+ Segmenting customers on spending in different categories/sectors.

#### Project 4: Train a Smartcab to Drive 
+ Reinforcement Learning: Implementing Q-learning algorithm.


Note: One CNN project is required to classify dog breed. I will finish it later as it has the same concepts like some of CNN projects I have done in self-driving car program.
